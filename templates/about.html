			<h2>Project Background</h2>

However, for individuals who are deaf and dumb, the lack of a common language can lead to isolation and frustration. The inspiration for this project stems from the urgent need to provide a seamless means of communication for these individuals, enabling them to express themselves effectively and engage in meaningful conversations</h3>
